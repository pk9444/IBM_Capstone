### Forecasting the Highest Stock Price of RIC over time with Advanced Machine Learning

## Project Goals

- To forecast/predict the daily highest stock price for RICs for the upcoming based on the historical data from January 2019 to 2023.
- Determine what features have the strongest impact on the daily highest price of an RIC with feature engineering.  
- Cross-validate the Random Forest Regressor from the Machine Learning stack and the LSTM Recurrent Neural Network from the Deep Learning stack for the time-series analysis.
- Deploy the best-performing model as an interactive flask-based web application that predicts the next 6-month average daily highest prices in real-time.
- Enable buyers and investors in informed business decisions through actionable insights generated by the forecasts of the Machine Learning/Neural Network model.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Results  

### Stock Dataset: 

- **Data Shape:** 501,625 records and 6 features (columns)
  
- **Number of duplicate records:** 15257

- **NULL Check:**
- ![NULL_check](https://github.com/pk9444/IBM_Capstone/assets/57378806/97de5acc-6465-4580-898b-cd348ed0e052)

- **Univariate Analysis: Frequency Distribution and Outlier Detection:**
-![outliers](https://github.com/pk9444/IBM_Capstone/assets/57378806/314da5bc-8382-4120-bd25-9bc35a814302)
 **The same, nearly identical right-skewed distribution is followed by the Opening and Closing Prices as well. And, they too have a large no. of large outliers like this. 

- **NULL Imputation:**
  - Drop the records that have a NULL date
  - Replace NULLs for highest, opening, closing prices, and trading volume with the **median** for a given RIC for that year and month.
  - Mean imputation is not suitable because it assumes normal distribution and is highly outlier sensitive.
  - On the other hand, directly dropping the NULLs for continuous features may lead to a loss of overall information.
  - Mode imputation does not work here because it is used for categorical features.

- **Multivariate Analysis:**
- ![correlation](https://github.com/pk9444/IBM_Capstone/assets/57378806/62dd055a-3a3e-4614-bbbd-0ffe73020ba1)
- The opening and closing prices have the strongest correlation to the target variable - highest stock price.
- The daily trading volume has a very low correlation compared to the other two features.
- Although very strongly correlated, the opening and closing price may possibly cause multicollinearity.
- To address it, add a new calculated feature called `Daily Return` which is defined as `Opening Price - Closing Price` for a given day. 
 

## Most Important Features Impacting the Highest Stock Price

![feature_importance](https://github.com/pk9444/IBM_Capstone/assets/57378806/66cf58db-5165-4851-9f1d-52c91b26753f)

- The daily opening and closing prices have the strongest impact on the highest price for any given trading day.
- Quantitatively speaking, the opening and closing, together contribute to ~87%-88% importance in determining the highest stock price.
- The daily trading volume has a very low feature importance and hence, it does not add much information in forecasting the highest stock price.
- The daily return also has a low feature importance, but it is a viable candidate to be included in the feature as it is derived from the two most important features. 
- Based on the insights, two possible combinations of feature sets were recommended to predict the daily average highest price:
  - `{Opening Price, Closing Price}` (* throughout the iterative lifecycle, it was found out that this combination performs slightly better)
  - `{Opening Price, Closing Price, Daily Return}` 

## Model Building 

### Random Forest Regressor

### Drawbacks of Regression in time-series forecasting 
- The Random Forest regressor fails to capture the temporal nature of time-series data while making predictions for any further timesteps.
- Consider a real-time example -> to predict the highest stock price of an RIC for the upcoming month - November 2023.
- Factors impacting November 2023:
  - The historical `Average Highest Price` for the past at least 6-12 months.
  - And the highest prices for the past 6-12 months in turn depend upon the `Average Opening Price`, `Average Closing Price` based on feature engineering. 
-The Random forest, or any regressor for that instance, **fails to capture this very temporal or seasonal nature of a time-series historical data**.
- It can only predict based on the feature set for the current instance which is not available for the next months.
- Hence, this explains its bad performance on the Regression metrics and explains why it is not suitable for time-series forecasting.

### Advantages of the LSTM Recurrent Neural Network  
- On the other hand, the LSTM captures this very temporal aspect by creating the lag sequences from the feature vector and feeding it as input to the LSTM's output layer. 
- Consider the same real-time example as aforementioned.
- For a given RIC:
  - LSTM creates lagging sequences of the feature vector for the past 12 months, depending upon how many lags one wants to create.
  - Each lag captures the feature vector for the preceding month and so on. 
  - So, the forecasted highest price for November 2023 includes the sequence {`Average Opening`, `Average Closing Price`} for the last 12 months.
  - Define the number of output layers for how many predictions are required. For forecasting the next N-months, set `N + 1` layers - the current month + the upcoming N months. 
- In this way, the LSTM captures the temporal aspect of historical data in time-series which explains its much better performance on the Regression Testing metrics.
